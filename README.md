# Digital Control - LabVIEW Implementation  

This repository contains LabVIEW files and circuit schematics for a university project in the *Digital Control* course. The project focuses on implementing and analyzing different discrete-time controllers using LabVIEW and a 2nd order analog emulator system.  

## Project Overview  

In this project, we:  
- Designed and implemented digital control systems using the following techniques:  
  - **PI Controller**  
  - **PID Controller**  
  - **Integral Compensator**  
- Developed a **2nd order analog emulator system**, which electronically mimics an analog process.  
- Interfaced the system with a **USB DAQ card (NI USB-6008/6002)** for real-time data acquisition and control.  
- Implemented structured control algorithms in **LabVIEW** for real-time discrete-time control tasks.

## Requirements  

- **LabVIEW** (Version used in the project: *Specify your version*)  
- **NI USB-6008/6002 DAQ card**  
- **Circuit implementation based on the provided schematic**  

## How to Use  

1. **Set up the hardware**: Connect the analog emulator system to the NI USB-6008/6002 DAQ card.  
2. **Open the LabVIEW files**: Load the `.vi` files in LabVIEW.  
3. **Run the desired controller**: Execute either the PI, PID, or Integral Compensator `.vi` to observe the system response.  
4. **Analyze the results**: Monitor real-time data acquisition and controller performance.
